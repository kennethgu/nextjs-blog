          From 6.S896: for a Gaussian distribution, we can estimate the mean <InlineMath math="\mu"/> by the empirical mean <InlineMath math="\hat{\mu}"/>. A relatively straightforward proof using concentration tools shows
          <BlockMath math="\|\hat{\mu} - \mu\| \leq \sqrt{\frac{\text{Tr } \Sigma}{n}} + \sqrt{\frac{2\|\Sigma\|_{\text{op}} \log(1/\delta)}{n}}"/>
          with probability <InlineMath math="\geq 1-\delta"/>. In fact, this holds for any sub-Gaussian distribution. But in general, the existence of <InlineMath math="\Sigma"/> is not enough for the naive empirical mean to achieve a similar bound. However, this performance is achievable by a different estimator! The <Link href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00482" className="accented hover:underline">Lugosi-Mendelson estimator</Link> from 2017 achieves this bound using a median-of-means approach: split the observations into appropriately sized buckets, take the empirical mean of each bucket, and output the &quot;median&quot; of the buckets.

          From 286: learned from <Link href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2017.1366909" className="accented hover:underline">Gelman and Imbens (2018)</Link> paper featured on pset that the use of higher-order polynomials in regression discontinuity designs leads to bias on the order of the degree --- that is, higher-order polynomials lead to lower bias --- but variance increases dramatically, making them undesirable in most settings

          Learned that the inverse of a doubly stochastic matrix with nonnegative entries is a doubly stochastic matrix. Makes intuitive sense if we think about such a matrix as a transition matrix for a reversible Markov chain.

          Learned about Alice Roosevelt&apos;s life as the eldest daughter of Teddy Roosevelt: her rebellious adolescence, tumultuous marriage to Longworth, relationship with Borah, and behind-the-scenes impact on American politics. White House Princess was such a beautiful show :&apos;)

          From 6.7910: <Link href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10200" className="accented hover:underline">Cooper (2018)</Link> demonstrates that for overparameterized neural networks (say <InlineMath math="n"/> parameters, <InlineMath math="d"/> parameters), the locus of global minima typically forms a <InlineMath math="n-d"/> dimensional submanifold.

          Was already familiar with Stein&apos;s identity in one dimension but was unaware of the higher dimensional generalization. From 224, letting <InlineMath math="\gamma"/> be the density of <InlineMath math="\mathcal{N}(0,I_d)"/>, if <InlineMath math="S_\ell(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{(-1)^{\ell}}{\gamma(x)} \nabla^{(\ell)} \gamma(x)"/>, then Stein&apos;s identity applies to nice functions <InlineMath math="f"/> as
          <BlockMath math="\mathbb{E}[f(\mathbf{x}) \cdot S_\ell(\mathbf{x})] = \mathbb{E}[\nabla^{(\ell)} f(\mathbf{x})]"/>
          which provides a way to learn MLPs using tensor methods.

          From 211: consider testing the hypothesis <InlineMath math="H_0 : \theta = \theta_0"/> against <InlineMath math="H_1 : \theta \neq \theta_0"/>. Under regularity conditions, given i.i.d. samples from <InlineMath math="f_\theta"/>, the likelihood ratio statistic under <InlineMath math="H_0"/> has some nice asymptotic properties. That is, 
          <BlockMath math="2 \log \Lambda_n \overset{d}{\to} \chi_1^2"/>
          More generally, Wilks&apos; theorem considers the LR test statistic under <InlineMath math="H_0 : \theta \in \Theta_0"/> against <InlineMath math="H_1 : \theta \in \Theta_1"/>. Then, under regularity conditions,
          <BlockMath math="2 \log \Lambda_n \overset{d}{\to} \chi^2_{\dim \Theta_1 - \dim \Theta_0}"/>

          From 6.S896: in a DAG, we say that two subsets <InlineMath math="A,B"/> are <InlineMath math="d"/>-separated by another subset <InlineMath math="S"/> any path between <InlineMath math="A,B"/> is blocked by <InlineMath math="S"/>. In the context of Bayes net, if <InlineMath math="A,B"/> are not <InlineMath math="d"/>-separated by <InlineMath math="S"/> then, there&apos;s a distribution that factorizes according to the DAG such that <InlineMath math="x_A,x_B"/> are dependent given <InlineMath math="S"/>.

          From 224: Massart noise, where we assign some <InlineMath math="\eta(x) \leq \eta"/> probability of coruption for each point (i.e., corruption can depend on covariates), might seem like an easier problem compared to random classification noise, but the additional structure makes it harder. The LeakyReLU-based algorithm for RCN no longer works, but there&apos;s a neat algorithm called the FilterTron that gets around this new barrier

          Learned that you can sometimes get the moon to perfectly cast a shadow on a model of the moon and earth during a solar eclipse â€“ it was a little too partial in Boston to make the model work right, but the little crescent in the sky was still pretty cool.

          Recall that low temperatures are useful for propagating information down a binary Ising tree. On the other hand, using Glauber dynamics to sample from the Ising model is more efficient at high temperatures. There&apos;s a similar phase transition when considering the mixing time with respect to some distance (e.g., TV distance).

          From 6.S896: suppose we have a binary tree, with each node taking a value in <InlineMath math="\{\pm 1\}"/>, where each node takes its parent&apos;s value with probability <InlineMath math="1 - p"/> and otherwise switches. We might be interested in extracting the root value given the nodes at level <InlineMath math="h"/>. This turns out to be a problem with a sharp phase transition: for <InlineMath math="p < (2 - \sqrt{2})/4"/>, this problem is solvable (i.e., the TV distance remains bounded from <InlineMath math="0"/>). Otherwise, the TV distance goes to zero and the problem is thus unsolvable.

          A nice formalization of a concept I already kind of knew: from 6.7910, given some class of functions <InlineMath math="\mathcal{F}"/> and a loss function <InlineMath math="L"/>, we call <InlineMath math="\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{F}"/> a universal hypothesis space if <InlineMath math="\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} L(f) = \inf_{h \in \mathcal{H}} L(h)" />.

          From 286: consider a multiple linear regression model with centered covariates of the form 
          <BlockMath math="Y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \mathbf{\gamma}^\top \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_i + \epsilon_i" />
          where <InlineMath math="\tilde{\mathbf{X}}"/> are centered covariates. There&apos;s an efficiency gain from including covariates if the model is correctly specified relative to the difference-in-means estimator, and while the gain can be lost if the model is incorrect, in most cases the efficiency improves. If we fully interact the model:
          <BlockMath math="Y_i = \alpha + \beta T_i + \mathbf{\gamma}^\top \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_i + \mathbf{\delta}^\top T_i \tilde{\mathbf{X}}_i + \epsilon_i" />
          then <InlineMath math="\hat{\beta}"/> is at least as efficient as the difference-in-means estimator.
