          Hoping to use this page to note one thing I learned each day! Keep me accountable :)

          Learned about <Link href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/docs/Tensors.pdf" className="accented hover:underline">tensor decomposition</Link> in 224 today â€“ specifically Jennrich&apos;s algorithm, which uses tensor contraction and nice properties of pseudoinverses and eigenvalues.

          Read a really awesome <Link href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/t-magazine/vanilla-spice-blandness.html?smid=url-share" className="accented hover:underline">NYT article</Link> about vanilla flavors: how vanilla went from exciting to bland, how fertilization was first adapted to the vanilla orchid by a 12 y/o enslaved child named Edmond Albius, how vanillin seems to be a universally enjoyed smell.

          Learned that <Link className="accented hover:underline" href="https://abcbirds.org/blog/flamingo-flight/">flamingos can fly</Link>! Some species even migrate long distances for the winter and can fly up to 40 mph.

          From Tom Goldstein&apos;s ML Foundations talk: inspired by the idea of type-I and type-II thinking in humans, we can train a <Link className="accented hover:underline" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04537">&quot;thinking net&quot;</Link> as an analog of slow thinking. Without skip connections, though, the network &quot;overthinks&quot; after too many steps. Thinking nets can be trained on smaller problems (e.g., 9x9 mazes) and still succeed on larger problems (e.g., 100x100 mazes).

          First day of MIT classes! From 6.S898: consider polling a population to determine the fraction of voters who support a proposition. Assuming i.i.d. queries, estimating p to within &epsilon; requires &Omega;(1/&epsilon;^2) queries. Proving the lower bound involves Le Cam&apos;s two point method, tensorization, and Pinsker&apos;s inequality.

          First real day of junior year classes! Learned about the diffraction limit in 224 today and <Link className="accented hover:underline" href='https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2004.07659'>algorithmic bounds</Link> for distinguishing k Airy disks with some minimum separation &Delta;. Roughly, there&apos;s a phase transition at a certain &Delta; where the sample complexity changes from exponential to polynomial in k. Proving the theorem (at least in one dimension) involves Fourier transforms and a clever construction and manipulation of matrices.

          Spent a little too much time trying to figure out how to use Next.js to create this website. Hoping that the steepest part of the learning curve is mostly over so that I can start spending more time on content/formatting.
